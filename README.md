To answer the question, how do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program, I will try and keep it brief. 
User needs are a hard topic, first you have what they need and then what they want. It should focus on what they need and 
then what they want. User stories help by outlining an idea, a rough draft as you will, and then shaping it as you go. 

I used to approach developing programs in the waterfall model simply because that was all I knew. Now that I have a 
better understanding of Agile and it's methods and principles I can move forward with greater clarity. There are a 
few different practices in agile I hope to take with me on future projects. The first would be Kanban. I believe a visual
representation of the work being done will greatly increase my ability to work on projects. Another great practice is 
using management tools such as Jira to help focus my efforts and allow me to monitor the project as I go. 

To be a good team member? That is by far the easiest question. To me it is all about work ethics and moral fortitude.
Work ethics such as, attending Scrum meetings, getting your work done, listening to others as well as communicating your 
own personal ideas. Open communication, honesty, and integrity will get the job done every time.
